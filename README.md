# PWA Text Editor


## Overview

This project is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) text editor that runs in the browser. The application meets PWA criteria and features data persistence techniques for redundancy, enabling offline functionality. It uses the 'idb' package, a lightweight wrapper for IndexedDB, to store and retrieve data.
